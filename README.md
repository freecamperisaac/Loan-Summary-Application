### Results and findings
Initial Analysis were found with SQL, some of the findings were based on:

- total funded amount
- month on month total funded application
- total received amount
- month to date total received amount
- month on month total received application

### Limitations 
some of the limitations were about removing all zero values from the datasets, some values in the date columns were not properly 
formatted and had to formatted well to not hinder the accuracy in the analysis and visualization stage,
and also in the modelling stage as i planned to have a data model to predict loan defualters using python.
even as building a website was invloved. it ws still an exploratry project so i had to talk to people to findout more about bank Loans, 
which helped in building up some KPI'S to direcct the Project.
